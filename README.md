# Firefox Responsive Design Mode Prototype

The Responsive Design Mode in Firefox has recently been redesigned and the existing design is less usable than the previous one, in my opinion. This is a prototype of the RDM which is supposed to drastically improve the usability of the component and make it shine, while keeping it lightweight.

## TO DO

* Add Device dialog
* Animations
* Visual polishing
